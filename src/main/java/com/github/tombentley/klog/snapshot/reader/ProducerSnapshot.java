 * For each topic partition, the broker maintains an in-memory mapping from the PID to the epoch,
 * sequence number, the last offset successfully written to the log, and the coordinator epoch
 * from each transactional producer. This is periodically stored in a {@code .snapshot} file.
 * The broker keeps the two most recent snapshots. If there is no snapshot when the broker
 * restarts, it rebuilds the map by scanning the full log.
